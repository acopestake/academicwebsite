abstract: We examine the effects of robotization on developing countries, extending the Ricardian model of Artuc, Bastos and Rijkers (2018) and drawing on new firm-level robotization data from eleven developing countries. We present four main results. First, robot adoption in advanced economies can ultimately benefit workers in developing countries through lower prices and increased demand for intermediate inputs – though there may be adverse effects in the short run, particularly for the least mobile workers. Second, continued Chinese subsidization of robots is likely to reduce China’s trade with OECD countries, while increasing that with developing countries – as China’s profile of comparative advantage increasingly aligns with the former. Third, larger and more globally-connected firms in developing countries are more likely to adopt robots, aligning with findings in developed countries, as they can afford the fixed costs of upgrading, and value the resulting precision more highly. Fourth, these firms expand post-adoption, increasing the competitive pressure on the smaller, less international firms in which those workers most vulnerable to replacement by robots are also more likely to work.
