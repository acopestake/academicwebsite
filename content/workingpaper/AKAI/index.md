abstract: With manufacturing increasingly dominated by China and industrial robotics, services-led development models have become targets for future employment growth. Increased capabilities in artificial intelligence could undermine this by displacing labour (e.g. chat-bots replacing call centres), or could support employment by increasing worker productivity and creating new tasks or products. Greater AI capabilities in rich countries could drive task reshoring, or create new tasks to offshore (e.g. data tagging). We first use existing AI measures to investigate these forces in administrative data on the Indian services sector, and find evidence consistent with firm-level productivity effects and industry-level displacement effects. Current work in progress uses 32 million vacancy postings from Indiaâ€™s largest online jobs platform to extend the analysis.
