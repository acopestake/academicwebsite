abstract: We examine the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on hiring and wages in service sector firms, using a novel dataset of vacancy posts from Indiaâ€™s largest jobs website. We first document a rapid rise in demand for machine learning (ML) skills since 2016, particularly in the IT, finance and professional services industries. Vacancies requiring ML skills list substantially higher wages, but require more education and are highly concentrated both geographically and in the largest firms. Exploiting plausibly exogenous variation in exposure to advances in AI capabilities, we then examine the impacts of establishment demand for ML skills, as a proxy for AI adoption. We find that growth in the demand for ML skills has a direct negative impact on the total number of vacancies posted by incumbent firms. Drawing on rich data on wage offers, we further find that growth in ML demand reduces wage offers for all but the lowest-paid roles.
