abstract: The take-off in cryptoasset adoption globally was accompanied by a rapid proliferation of policy announcements concerning digital assets. We use a cross-country panel of crypto trading volumes to examine the responses of crypto markets to policy announcements about both bans, which attempt to prohibit some form of crypto activity, and central bank digital currency projects, which provide an alternative digital asset that may be more attractive for some users. We find that growth in trading volume falls by up to 72% in the week after the announcement of a ban, and by up to 25% after a CBDC-supportive speech by senior central bank officials. For the strictest bans, this reduction in growth persists over the subsequent quarter, driven by a reduction in trading by institutional investors. We conclude that crypto market participants pay significant attention to government policy on digital assets.
