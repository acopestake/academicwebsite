2002q2,0.414618883,-1.147440927,,,,,"These are estimated from the CCAT which had a standard deviation of 1 over the sample period, whereas official GDP had a standard deviation of 2.35 percent. "
2002q3,0.227739791,-0.846862365,,,,,"I.e., a one percent move in official GDP is equivalent to a 1/2.35 unit move in the CCAT and shock series."
2002q4,-0.183463007,-0.694900389,,,,,"Therefore, to convert regression estimates based on a 1 unit change in this shock series to estimates interpretable as responses to a 1 percent change in GDP, multiply the coefficients by 1/2.35"
